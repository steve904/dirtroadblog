Growing Up On A Dirt Road...

### About

Yep...I grew up on a dirt road. Most of the roads that were around us were paved but for some reason our road remained dirt for many years. 

### Big Tree

We had a beautiful giant tree opposite our driveway. It was located in a slight curve in the road. Loved that tree. It was what we stood under as we waited for the school bus. 

### Big Dusty

When the weather was dry, the road was dusty. When the rain fell the road would develop wash boards (ridges). A neighbor had a piece of heavy equipment called a road scrape. When the road became rough, out came the road scrape and we were back in business again with a smooth road with small amounts of gravel and rock on top. 

### Speed Limit

You really didn't have to worry about a speed limit on the dirt road because most of the time it was so dusty you kept your speed under 30 mph to keep from being covered up by the dust. 

One man that lived on this road would go much faster than everyone else and we loved to see him fly by like a fast, dust-clouded tornado. The road had a special gravelly sound to it also. I miss the dirt road because of the memories, but it is much better on your car to have a paved road. We had some dusty cars back then.
