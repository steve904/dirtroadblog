I invite you to write an article of your choice for this blog. Don't worry about pictures...I can find some for you online if you like. 

This is great for the people that want to write one or more articles without keeping up with a web site. Dirt Road Blog is a place where you can share your story or stories with others. 

### Comments

At the moment I do not have comments turned on. As a matter of fact, I have not figured out how to turn comments on. 

### Plain Text

When you write your story you can text me with the article or just use a simple text editor and save it as the name of the article plus .txt

You can then send your article to my gmail. Message me on facebook and I will give you my email address.
