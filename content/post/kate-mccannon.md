```
Well the raven is a wicked bird 
His wings are black as sin
And he floats outside my prison window mocking those within
And he sings to me real low, it's hell to where you go
For you did murder Kate McCannon
```
```
When I first met Tom McCannon 
I was working in the mines
Said he had himself a dark-haired daughter with long, green eyes
When she and I did meet, she was bathing in the creek
Prettiest girl in the whole damn holler 
That ain't no lie
```
```
So I went a courtin' Kate McCannon
Got me a job and I quit my ramblin'
And every day I'd save a quarter of my pay
I could buy a diamond ring
```
```
Lord, and one day I come home to find
My darlin' angel's not inside
So I made for the creek
Where she and I did meet
And found her with some other lover
```
```
And I put three rounds into Kate McCannon
