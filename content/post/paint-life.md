### Choices

So you want to make a change in your life. I can tell you right up front that the majority of change is up to you. The choices that you make have a dramatic impact on your life. Remember when you make choices, that person you look at in the mirror is more amazing than you probably have been giving credit to over all these years. That person is fully capable of making incredible choices.

### Sling & Arrows
Everybody has suffered at one point or another from the slings & arrows that life has thrown at them. When you get knocked down don't just get back up but jump back up. Tell yourself that "I'm strong enough to overcome this. You just don't know how tough I am".

### New Day - New Beginning

You can have a new beginning to your life at any moment. Wake up with a smile on your face. Pay attention to your kids, dogs, cats, horses or whatever you feel you should pay attention to. Give your all to your surroundings. Gratitude feeds the soul, so feed your soul massive amounts of gratitude. It takes a very conscious effort to give thanks for everything you have.

### Brush Strokes

Every decision & every choice you make is like an artistic brush stroke that you add to your life. Be aware of your decisions and make strong, happy decisions throughout your day. Paint your life as a beautiful portrait that you truly admire and love. ~End~    <sm>-*Stephen H Causey*-</sm>
