      <description>Iron and Cloth Barber Shop What a great barber shop. The barbers are very friendly and welcoming. They also know how to cut hair very, very well. They are located at 214 West Friendly Avenue, Greensboro, North Carolina. Give yourself a treat and book an appointment with them or just walk in and ask for a hair cut.

Juke Box The first thing you will probably notice when you walk into Iron and Cloth is the old Werlitzer juke box.</description>
