      <description>Iron and Cloth Barber Shop What a great barber shop. The barbers are very friendly and welcoming. They also know how to cut hair very, very well. They are located at 214 West Friendly Avenue, Greensboro, North Carolina. Give yourself a treat and book an appointment with them or just walk in and ask for a hair cut.
Casey Gaulden - Owner of Iron and Cloth
Juke Box The first thing you will probably notice when you walk into Iron and Cloth is the old Werlitzer juke box.</description>

Choices So you want to make a change in your life. I can tell you right up front that the majority of change is up to you. The choices that you make have a dramatic impact on your life. Remember when you make choices, that person you look at in the mirror is more amazing than you probably have been giving credit to over all these years. That person is fully capable of making incredible choices.</description>
